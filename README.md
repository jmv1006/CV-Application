## Project Information

This project was a huge stepping stone for myself, as I really had to dig deep in order to get everything to work the way
I wanted it to work. From the get-go, I had a few issues figuring out how exactly to structure the project and it's various components. With some planning and A LOT of thinking, I was able to really become comfortable with a few core concepts:

### Components

Before I started learning React, I had always assumed that figuring out the structure of an app & it's components would be simple.
I soon learned that I was wrong. Working with components required me to really "buckle down" and get a solid foundation set for what I wanted my app to look like. Which components would go where?  Which components would be a child of another? Solving questions like these allowed me to realize that the planning proccess of an app is just as, if not more important than the actual implementation of the app itself in code.

### Props & State

Props & State were very tricky for me to understand at first mainly due to my initial lack of planning. I learned that having a clean and straightforward component structure was necessary in order for me to use props and state to their full extent. A major hurdle I faced was learning how to pass things up AND down using props and state. After a while, I started to think of such transfer as a sort of "electricity line". In order for electricity to get to my room, for example, it must first come from it's source, into my neighborhood, then into my house, and finally route it's way to my room. Once I established this idea, I was able to become comfortable with working with props and state.
